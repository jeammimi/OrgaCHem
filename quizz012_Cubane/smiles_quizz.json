  "quizz_info_1":  "Cubane's fun shape pushes the boundaries of normal bonding rules! Before it was synthetized in the 60's it was believed that this type of molecule would be too unstable to exist. It turned out that is a stable high energy molecule. It’s derivative octanitrocubane is a high explosive the likes of T.N.T.",
