   "quizz_info_1":"Salbutemol, also known as albuterol, is mostly known among asmathic people under its marketed name: Ventolin. It is used to treat asthma. It is sold under as a racemic mixture. The (R)-enantiomer is the pharmacologically active enantiomer. The (S)-enantiomer has a slow metabolism, which can lead to accumulation in the lungs and cause airway hyperreactivity and inflammation.",
