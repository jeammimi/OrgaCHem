   "quizz_info_1":"Thyroxine is a tyrosine-based hormone used in case of hypothyroidism (not enough thyroid hormones are produced from the thyroid gland) as these hormones are mainly responsible for the regulation of the metabolism. Mid-2017, Levothyrox (thyroxineâ€™s trade name), one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in France, is at the center of a controversy as thousands of people using the new formula, released in March 2017, complain of serious side effects.",
