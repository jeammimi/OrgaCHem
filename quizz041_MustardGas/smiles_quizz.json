   "quizz_info_1":"Mustard gas is a chemical warfare agent which was first used during World War I. A teaspoonful of this reagent is a lethal dose. This liquid dissolves in fat and penetrates the skin. Inside the cell it corrupts DNA and proteins. Recovery can take months. Mustard gas was first called LOST in reference to the two chemists who engineered it: Wilhelm LOmmel and Wilhelm STeinkopf. Interestingly, doctors found that infection by mustard gas led to a decrease of immune cells in blood; hence they assumed it could destroy cancerous cells. They developed nitrogen mustard for this use and gave birth to chemotherapy.",
