   "quizz_info_1":"Baclofen is a GABA agonist used as a skeletal muscle relaxant. Though it is commercialized in its racemic form, it is believed that only the R enantiomer is active. Since 2002, baclofen is giving promising results for treatment of alcoholism. A 2016 study suggest that only the R enantiomer is responsible for suppressing alcohol-motivated behaviors.",
